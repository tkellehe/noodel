# Noodel

## What is this?

_Noodel_ has done a good job at getting my feet wet with making a language for code-golfing ASCII-Animation challenges, but I broke
some of my own rules with _Noodel_. There are parts added to _Noodel_ that are not related to ASCII-Animation that actually hurt it
in challenges. This directory is what the next big change to _Noodel_ will be. First there will be a complete re-write of the internal
structure of source code. BUT, before all of that there will be some structure to the documentation! So, without further ado here is
what _Noodel_ will look like:)

## Introduction

[_Noodel_]() is a language designed for code-golfing ASCII-Animation challenges. You can go [here]() for different versions of _Noodel_.
There is an online interpreter for _Noodel_ [here](). You can also find a list of commands [here]().

## Versions?

Rolling the first number means that the new version of _Noodel_ could break old challenges. Rolling the second number means a bug fix
and/or new feature.

## Hello, World!

Here is a simple `Hello, World!` in _Noodel_:

```
Hello,¤World!
```

To get started _Noodel_ uses the following characters as the __printable__ characters:

```
ð¬¶¤!"#$%&'()*+,-./0123456789:;<=>?@ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ[\]^_`abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz{|}~
```

These characters are what are used to create string literals in _Noodel_. The character `¤` represents a space and the character
`¶` represents a newline.

## Memory Model


## Challenges

Since _Noodel_ is made for challenges, create an issue each time you use _Noodel_ in a challenge. This helps others learn how to
use _Noodel_ and can help with golfing down the solution. For these issues, name it `TheChallengeTitle - MyUsername` and place a 
link to the challenge as well as a link to your answer. Also, place some explanation for as to how it works with a link to
run the script. If it gets golfed down, just place as another comment:)
