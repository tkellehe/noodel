[_Noodel_](https://tkellehe.github.io/noodel) is a programming language that has the main focus of assisting ASCII Art code golfing challenges (and eventually other art/animation challenges). The main thing to focus on is the memory model of _Noodel_ which acts as a pipe of information moving through the different tokens. (In progress...) There also is a system of arrays that can be utilized and navigated in order to have a persistant memory. Since this has already turned into a paragraph of random information about _Noodel_, it also has its own 256-byte [code page](code_page.md).
