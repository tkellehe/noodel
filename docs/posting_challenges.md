# Posting Challenges

This page discusses how to post challenges that use [_Noodel_](https://tkellehe.github.io/noodel/docs/posting_challenges.html).

## Posting

To post, visit the [issues page](https://github.com/tkellehe/noodel/issues) and create a new issue. Name the issue the title of the challenge followed by your name: __TheChallengeName - UserName__
Then add the label __challenge__ and any others that apply (if there is a label that you must have just ask). In the body of the issue,
place a link to the challenge and a link to your answer. Also, include the number of bytes/score along with the script. Include a link to
a test program where the script can be ran. Finally, include some kind of description explaining how it works.

## Other Notes

If you have a stroke of genious that reduces the number of bytes, fixes the answer, or anything else that changes the origional post, 
merely add a comment with the number of bytes/score, explanation, link to example, and the new script.

If you happen to beat all of the others in the challenge please put the __won__ label on there so I can cry tears of joy:)
